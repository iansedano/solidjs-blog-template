# [SolidStart](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start) Blog Template

This is a personal blog template for SolidStart. It's a work in progress and not yet ready for use.

The tentative requirements for this template are:

- A simple, clean and adaptable design using Tailwind CSS.
- A separate markdown file for each blog post -- plain markdown files with YAML front matter.
- Markdown files in designated directory are automatically converted to blog posts.
- Front matter schema validation.
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks.
- Configurable.
- No manual pre-render step required for development or build.
