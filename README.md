# [SolidStart](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start) Blog Template

This is a basic blog template for SolidStart in development.

The requirements for this template are:

- A simple, clean and adaptable design using Tailwind CSS.
- A separate markdown file for each blog post, without the need for writing in MDX. Just plain markdown files with YAML front matter.
- Should be able to add new blog posts by just adding a markdown file to designated folder.
- Include syntax highlighting for code blocks.
- Configurable for things such as themes for syntax highlighting.
- No manual pre-render step required for development or build.
- Shouldn't keep all of the blog post data in one big JSON to serve to the client, should just serve what's needed and then pre-fetch the rest when needed.
